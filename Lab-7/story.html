                One day detective was sent to investigate where he found the caretakers body on the first floor. Vocal cords ripped out lying in a pool of blood.
                The old lady was ruled out as a suspect because she was immobile. But the detective did note that the crime seem familiar to how the widowed husband died years ago.
                he had suffocated in his sleep on the coach downstairs when the lady was upstairs 
                After getting evidence from the first floor crime scene the detective asked him to look upstairs the old lady refused at first but he insisted and went upstairs anyways.

                Everything seemed pretty normal until a shocking revelation came over him and it sent chills down his spine.
                It was a detail the investigatoors had overlooked in the murder of the widows husband as well.

                There is no phone on the second floor.
            </p>

                Detective suddenly heard a noise which drew his attention/weapon and ran out of the room only to find an empty chair.
